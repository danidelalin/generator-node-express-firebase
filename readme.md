# Node Express Firebase Stack generator

> Yeoman generator for creating FEN stack applications, using Firebase, Express, and Node - lets you quickly set up a project following best practices.

> generator-node-express-mongo originated from generator-angular-fullstack v2.1.1 


* model.seed.json to the new endpoint folder under api/model
* addition to config/seed.js to load Model, Seed Data, clear any existing data in the DB, and loads the new seed data


## Example project

Generated with defaults from parent repo (DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack): http://fullstack-demo.herokuapp.com/.

Source code: https://github.com/Liam-Williams/generator-node-express-mongo

## Usage

Install `generator-node-express-mongo`:
```
npm install -g generator-node-express-mongo
```

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run `yo node-express-mongo`, optionally passing an app name:
```
yo node-express-mongo [app-name]
```

Run `grunt` for building, `grunt serve` for preview, and `grunt serve:dist` for a preview of the built app.

## Prerequisites

* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) - If you plan on scaffolding your project with mongoose, you'll need mongoDB to be installed and have the `mongod` process running.

## Supported Configurations

**Server**

* Database: `None`, `MongoDB`
* Authentication boilerplate: `Yes`, `No`
* oAuth integrations: `Facebook` `Twitter` `Google`
* Socket.io integration: `Yes`, `No`

## Generators

Available generators:

* App
    - [node-express-mongo](#app) (aka [node-express-mongo:app](#app))
* Server Side
    - [node-express-mongo:endpoint](#endpoint)
* Deployment
    - [node-express-mongo:openshift](#openshift)
    - [node-express-mongo:heroku](#heroku)

### App
Sets up a new Npde Express Mongo app, generating all the boilerplate you need to get started.

Example:
```bash
yo node-express-mongo
```

### Endpoint
Generates a new API endpoint.


Example:
```bash
yo node-express-mongo:endpoint message
[?] What will the url of your endpoint be? /api/messages
```

Produces:

    server/api/message/index.js
    server/api/message/message.spec.js
    server/api/message/message.controller.js
    server/api/message/message.model.js  (optional)
    server/api/message/message.seed.json  (optional)
    server/api/message/message.socket.js (optional)


###Openshift

Deploying to OpenShift can be done in just a few steps:

    yo node-express-mongo:openshift

A live application URL will be available in the output.

> **oAuth**
>
> If you're using any oAuth strategies, you must set environment variables for your selected oAuth. For example, if we're using Facebook oAuth we would do this :
>
>     rhc set-env FACEBOOK_ID=id -a my-openshift-app
>     rhc set-env FACEBOOK_SECRET=secret -a my-openshift-app
>
> You will also need to set `DOMAIN` environment variable:
>
>     rhc set-env DOMAIN=<your-openshift-app-name>.rhcloud.com
>
>     # or (if you're using it):
>
>     rhc set-env DOMAIN=<your-custom-domain>
>
> After you've set the required environment variables, restart the server:
>
>     rhc app-restart -a my-openshift-app

To make your deployment process easier consider using [grunt-build-control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control).

**Pushing Updates**

    grunt

Commit and push the resulting build, located in your dist folder:

    grunt buildcontrol:openshift

### Heroku

Deploying to heroku only takes a few steps.

    yo node-express-mongo:heroku

To work with your new heroku app using the command line, you will need to run any `heroku` commands from the `dist` folder.


If you're using mongoDB you will need to add a database to your app:

    heroku addons:add mongolab

Your app should now be live. To view it run `heroku open`.

> If you're using any oAuth strategies, you must set environment variables for your selected oAuth. For example, if we're using **Facebook** oAuth we would do this :
>
>     heroku config:set FACEBOOK_ID=id
>     heroku config:set FACEBOOK_SECRET=secret
>
> You will also need to set `DOMAIN` environment variable:
>
>     heroku config:set DOMAIN=<your-heroku-app-name>.herokuapp.com
>
>     # or (if you're using it):
>
>     heroku config:set DOMAIN=<your-custom-domain>
>

To make your deployment process easier consider using [grunt-build-control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control).

#### Pushing Updates

    grunt

Commit and push the resulting build, located in your dist folder:

    grunt buildcontrol:heroku


All of these can be updated with `bower update` as new versions are released.

## Configuration
Yeoman generated projects can be further tweaked according to your needs by modifying project files appropriately.

A `.yo-rc` file is generated for helping you copy configuration across projects, and to allow you to keep track of your settings. You can change this as you see fit.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the client and server unit tests with karma and mocha.

Use `grunt test:server` to only run server tests.

## Environment Variables

Keeping your app secrets and other sensitive information in source control isn't a good idea. To have grunt launch your app with specific environment variables, add them to the git ignored environment config file: `server/config/local.env.js`.
